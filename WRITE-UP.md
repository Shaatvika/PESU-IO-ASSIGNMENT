Throughout this entire course, we were introduced to the world of Linux through simple and fun commands. The linux world was very fascinating to us windows users.
We learnt more in depth about syscalls and how our codes and programs work with kernel t produce the desired result. Apart from the technical knowledge, we also learnt
a few fun commands. 
The course gave us a deep but simple understanding about Linux. Our SME Siddharth Tewari, made sure we had fun and understood Linux properly.
